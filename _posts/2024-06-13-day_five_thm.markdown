30 Days of TryHackMe: Day 5
Welcome to 30 Days of TryHackMe, where I try to build a streak of learning through the website TryHackMe. Today I am picking up right where I left off on the Complete Beginner Path and tackle Cryptography.



The first room is Hashing — Crypto 101, a kind of introduction to the concept of cryptography. It goes over some definitions, and it goes over hashing. Hashing is taking an input of any size and creating a ‘digest’ of the input, of a fixed size. The output needs to be unique (even changing a little bit of the text should give out a new hash). A hash is, in theory, irreversible, but some hashes are more secure than others.

Passwords are stored in hashes, which is why they are useful to know about from a security perspective.

It then gives a few examples of how to find some hashes, some online and through other tools.


The next room is all about the password cracking tool John the Ripper. John the Ripper is a tool you can use in order to crack passwords, if you have the hash of the password. The room goes over a lot of the different ways to use John, and you will get a little bit of more experience with the tool through some challenges.


The final room of this section is Encryption — Crypto 101. This room is extremely theory heavy, and one of the first questions you ‘answer’ is to not complain about how theory heavy it is.


You are once again introduced to some definitions, but this room will go into the why of cryptography. Cryptography is essential for ensuring security in pretty much any context involving a computer. Doing this room also stresses the importance of the modulo operator (think something like 65 % 6) in cryptography.

This room also goes over the different kinds of encryption, keys and asymmetric cryptography, digital signatures, and a whole lot more. This is probably one of the more theory heavy rooms I’ve done so far, but it was good to learn a lot more about a topic I wasn’t too familiar with.

This section wasn’t too time consuming, but it did require a lot more thinking to be done than previous sections.
